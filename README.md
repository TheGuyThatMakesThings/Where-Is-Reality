# Where Is Reality
A game about losing reality and maybe even yourself due to a coma.

# 3DS OWNERS!
Switch to 3DS-latest for the most recent 3DS build.

I am trying to prioritize both ways to play the game, but computer is going to have the MOST up-to-date version of the game.


# Where is the computer build?
I'm working on it, this header will disappear when I have sorted things out.



# What are the targeted platforms?
Nintendo 3DS Homebrew, Computer, and in the future most likely Wii U and Switch Homebrew.


# How do I build the source code? (To be removed for computer-latest)
You'll need to use the LOVEBrew Bundler, this should be a good start and supplies a link to the bundler:
https://lovebrew.org/bundler-app/overview

Make sure the .zip structure is correct and throw it in the bundler, that should spit out a .3dsx file.




# What is this game based off?
Undertale and Deltarune, I just really like how those games play out.
