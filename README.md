# Where-Is-Reality
A game about losing reality and maybe even yourself due to a coma.


NOTE: I am still working on build one so there is no source code yet, just wait a bit.


# What are the targeted platforms?
Currently the Nintendo 3DS Homebrew Community, but theoretically I could also port to Wii U and Switch homebrew with almost no problems.

# What is this game based off?
Undertale and Deltarune, I just really like how those games play out.
