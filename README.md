# Where Is Reality
A game about losing reality and maybe even yourself due to a coma.

## IMPORTANT!!!
3DS version is currently non-functional if you build the game off the branch directly, prototype 1 will still work fine but any version downloaded off of this branch is broken. I have to come up with a fix that WILL modify 3DS and computer builds together.



### Notice
3DS does not take full priority for updates anymore, there may be missing features or extra bugs for it.



# What are the targeted platforms?
Nintendo 3DS Homebrew, Computer, and in the future most likely Wii U and Switch Homebrew.


# Project Inspiration?
Undertale and Deltarune.
