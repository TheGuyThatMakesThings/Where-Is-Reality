# Where Is Reality
A game about losing reality and maybe even yourself due to a coma.


### Notice
3DS does not take full priority for updates anymore, there may be missing features or extra bugs for it.



# What are the targeted platforms?
Currently the Nintendo 3DS Homebrew Community, but theoretically I could also port to Wii U and Switch homebrew with almost no problems.


# How do I build the source code?
You'll need to use the LOVEBrew Bundler, this should be a good start and supplies a link to the bundler:
https://lovebrew.org/bundler-app/overview

Make sure the .zip structure is correct and throw it in the bundler, that should spit out a .3dsx file.




# What is this game based off?
Undertale and Deltarune, I just really like how those games play out.
